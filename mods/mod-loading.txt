How to Mod Hunt the Wumpus

Loading a mod into the game:
  For a mod to be recognized by the game and loaded, it must be compiled into a
  shared object file. The game supports both Windows .dll files and Unix .so
  files. The shared object file must be placed into the folder named 'mods'
  which should be on the same directory level as the game executable.

Necessary mod format:
  Each mod should contain one or more classes that inherit from the classes in
  the base game. It should also contain a function labelel with 'extern "C"'
  with one of the expected names and signatures, that returns pointers to
  new instances of the class or classes. The allowed names and signatures are:
    - Event* getDefaultEvent()
    - GameSetup* getSetup(const Event* default)
    - Player* getPlayer(const GameSetup*)
    - std::vector<Player*> getPlayers(const GameSetup*)
    - Event* getEvent(const GameSetup*)
    - std::vector<Event*> getEvents(const GameSetup*)
    - Cave* getCave(const GameSetup*)

Loading Details:
  The DefaultEvent, GameSetup, and Cave objects will be set to the base game
  objects if no mod funciton providing one of them is found. Only one mod
  function providing each of these may be among the mod files. The Event
  objects returned by mod files will override the base game events if they
  have the same value of the eventName property. Otherwise, they will be added
  to the game in addition to the base game events. If any Player functions are
  found among the mod files, no additional players will be added to the game.
